# AHK Scripts for BTD6

### Prerequisites
To use a certain script, you don't need to have anything installed on your PC if you use the *.exe* files. However, these only work with my personal hotkeys so you likely want to use the *.ahk* files, for which you need to have the respective version of AutoHotkey installed on your PC. You can download all versions on https://www.autohotkey.com/.

In the README.md file of every script, you can find all the info needed to run the scripts.
